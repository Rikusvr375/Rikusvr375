## Hi there 👋

- My skills🤹🏼‍♂️:
    I am currently fluent in creating HTML sheets to dispaly work properly and use CSS to customize it to any specific needs.
    I understand the fundementals of Tailwind CSS and it creates clean and proper looking code.
    If I don't understand a piece of code, I won't be stressing about it at all because of my expert research skills I have built throughout the past few months.
    In my line of work, organizing is a crucial step in becoming a good software developer. So I am confident to say that I am a pro in clean work with meaning behind every structure.

    
- What I am currently working on🛠️:
    At this moment, finishing my course at CodeSpace is my biggest priority, as it will give me a proper headstart in the tech/software world.
    In the next few months I will be focusing on learning JavaScript, as it is a super popular language for big developers.
    There is always room for improvement. Thus I won't stop improving my HTML and CSS skills to be the best version of a software developer I can possibly be.


- Lines of work I am looking for🔎:
    I am looking for a job that will give me the necessary real-life experiences to give me a good understanding in working with clients and the big software world.
